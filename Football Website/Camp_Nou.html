        <h3>Camp Nou: </h3>
        <p class="decoration"> It has hosted two European Cup/Champions League finals in 1989 and 1999, two European Cup Winners' Cup finals, four Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final games, five UEFA Super Cup games, four Copa del Rey finals, two Copa de la Liga finals and twenty-one Supercopa de España finals. It also hosted five matches in the 1982 FIFA World Cup (including the opening game), two out of four matches at the 1964 European Nations' Cup and the football tournament's final at the 1992 Summer Olympics.
            On 15 March 2022, it was announced that music streaming service Spotify had reached a deal with Barcelona to acquire the naming rights to the stadium in a deal worth $310 million. Following the approval of the sponsorship agreement with Spotify by Barcelona's Extraordinary Assembly of Delegate Members on 3 April 2022, the stadium was officially renamed on 1 July 2022 as Spotify Camp Nou.
            In April 2022, it was announced that renovation of the stadium would commence in June 2023 after the season's end. It is expected to be completed during the 2025/26 season.
