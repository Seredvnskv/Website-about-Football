        <h3>Alianz Arena: </h3>
        <p class="decoration">
          Allianz Arena is a football stadium in Munich, Bavaria, Germany, with a 70,000 seating capacity for international matches and 75,000 for domestic matches. Widely known for its exterior of inflated ETFE plastic panels, it is the first stadium in the world with a full colour changing exterior. Located at 25 Werner-Heisenberg-Allee at the northern edge of Munich's Schwabing-Freimann borough on the Fröttmaning Heath, it is the second-largest arena in Germany behind Westfalenstadion in Dortmund.
          FC Bayern Munich has played its home games at the Allianz Arena since the start of the 2005/06 season. The club had previously played their home games at the Munich Olympic Stadium since 1972. 1860 Munich previously had a 50 per cent share in the stadium, but Bayern Munich purchased their shares for €11 million in April 2006 due to 1860 Munich suffering from financial issues. The arrangement allowed 1860 Munich to play at the stadium while retaining no ownership until 2025
          However, in July 2017 Bayern terminated the rental contract with 1860, making themselves the sole tenants of the stadium.
          In UEFA club and Nations League matches, it is known as the Fußball Arena München, and it hosted the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final[6] and will host the upcoming 2025 final, moved from 2023.
          Since 2012 the museum of Bayern Munich, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, has been located inside the Allianz Arena.
          n 2022, it hosted the first-ever regular season National Football League (NFL) American football game played in Germany as part of the NFL International Series.
